- the most important title is that your knowledge  have be Enough for solving the problems.
look at your resume and exam yourself , befor every thing, you could have the concepts of programming 
and developing.

- before start programming everytime, its necessary have ready mind to see the lot of new problems and solve them. if you have a special problem in your home with your family or friends and ... at first should pay attention to them and clear them that can write clear code.
maybe think that if you start programming with busy mind and it have been solve by itself is so wrong opinion. after a week or problem life, look at your old code , maybe the work at this time, but are they ready for tests,updates or good enough for optimizing ? its just waste your time and maybe you force to rewrite that code again.

- design patterns and code optimizing tricks are two golden Abilities that can distinguished you from other programmers , In other words
 these Abilities from the coder, turns you to a developer and programmer .
 
 - you could learn that saying NO so easily ! For everyone special programmers is so well that be a super man and 
 Makes the comebacks . It is not perfesional work . If you see the project need more time, or you can not do it, you should say this to your team manager. The CEOs should know the problems . Maybe they repeat their request and suggest you working at weekends or more time works, you could know if you can not say No, probably writing so diry code at the end, and
 You are not sure that can you finish the project or not . Say No if you know you cant .

- if find new framework or new programming lang or service, do not get carried away and forget your old beliefs to starting that and migrate your things on that . 

- your imporvment and learnung is not your team task.  You should work for your company and done the tasks, learning time is not at work. After work or weekends or at the way to go home(or work) you can do learning.

- in my opinion, the good function has 1-3 line of codes . 3-5 in not bad, 5-9 in ok,more than 10 line, should be two function !  

- at the firt of the develop, look at your project target, and find the best architect patterns and design for your work flow. You have no chance to have mistakes, couse the refactoring need new time and money ! The company never like it ðŸ˜…

- introduce yourself in your resume real and claerly, your art is that show yourself with simplest words, well.
