- the most important title is that your knowledge  have be Enough for solving the problems.
look at your resume and exam yourself , befor every thing, you could have the concepts of programming 
and developing.

- before start programming everytime, its necessary have ready mind to see the lot of new problems and solve them. if you have a special problem in your home with your family or friends and ... at first should pay attention to them and clear them that can write clear code.
maybe think that if you start programming with busy mind and it have been solve by itself is so wrong opinion. after a week or problem life, look at your old code , maybe the work at this time, but are they ready for tests,updates or good enough for optimizing ? its just waste your time and maybe you force to rewrite that code again.

- design patterns and code optimizing tricks are two golden Abilities that can distinguished you from other programmers , In other words
 these Abilities from the coder, turns you to a developer and programmer .
 
 - you could learn that saying NO so easily ! For everyone special programmers is so well that be a super man and 
 Makes the comebacks . It is not perfesional work . If you see the project need more time, or you can not do it, you should say this to your team manager. The CEOs should know the problems . Maybe they repeat their request and suggest you working at weekends or more time works, you could know if you can not say No, probably writing so diry code at the end, and
 You are not sure that can you finish the project or not . Say No if you know you cant .

- if find new framework or new programming lang or service, do not get carried away and forget your old beliefs to starting that and migrate your things on that . 

- your imporvment and learnung is not your team task.  You should work for your company and done the tasks, learning time is not at work. After work or weekends or at the way to go home(or work) you can do learning.

- in my opinion, the good function has 1-3 line of codes . 3-5 in not bad, 5-9 in ok,more than 10 line, should be two function !  

- at the firt of the develop, look at your project target, and find the best architect patterns and design for your work flow. You have no chance to have mistakes, couse the refactoring need new time and money ! The company never like it ðŸ˜…

- introduce yourself in your resume real and claerly, your art is that show yourself with simplest words, well.

- take a few minute or an hour a day to learning new things, see the other technologies and tools, you should be ready for chnage your work language or field in few year later . Be update !

- do not be a Fanatic on any programmer language or flow works methods, it is the cheeapest and the noobs have it. every method and programmer lang maybe is better than other in diffrent fields and conditions .

- if you have any interview or conferance , and you decide that do not go there, or you can not go there, you should tell them this problem. do not Notifying them is not an interesting job !

- it is not important that how much the project is force and you dont have enough time, this atmosfer fource you to make the bad and dirty code. If you could do it, know and say to your ceo that the codes of these part mabye will write again, couse they are real shit code !

- know that you are not for your wokr! your work is for you, i mean you are not suppost to work till a certain time, you could work everyday in your life , maybe someday it happnes that you wont coding anymore, but you should be healty for enjoy with your family wokrs or ... that th emost important thing is you and your life. i suggest you to spend some time on sports. 

- Code s written primarily for coworkers not compilers. The ultimate test is your code simple enough is can your fellow programmers with similar backgrounds understand your code? if your co-workers have a hard time understanding your code, investigate why. Maybe itâ€™s your code thatâ€™s too complex. Maybe there wasnâ€™t enough tests. Maybe you used an uncommon algorithm. The conversation about code is key.

- in the low ages, the small companies are better for you, you cant have many permision in larg groups, and in small ones can learning more and more than the bigs ...

- befor start and write the code, first should wrote his tests. Toppa is a fan of two kinds of tests: unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests test functionality in isolation. Integration tests ensure that a change over _here_ doesnâ€™t break something over _there_. Test-driven development is an approach that helps ensure that tests are in place and can help keep code clean.

- Be a master listener, one of the tricks is being a good listener to learn and understanding well ! Evrybody know how to speak and kill the time .

- Use intention revealing names. Choosing good names takes time but saves more than it takes.The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.

- code optimizing is not just one level in your project (if it need to optimization), in evey level of the project the optimization have some sections to do .

- a master programmer is not who has a lot of project , is who have a strong and perfect in most of his projects. be a master one.

- its ok that sometimes the have have force project and the time is going to the project deadline, but do not accept that work in your weekends and more that your task. yo can say NO easily sometime .


- keep in mind these words :
 1. "When reviewing code, count to 10 before you refactor a line. If the code does not have tests, a hundred." - Samer Buna

 2. "You need to study other people's work. Their approaches to problem solving and the tools they use give you a fresh way to look at your own work." - Gary Kildall
  
  3. "Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people, and to sit down and talk with customers and get their feedback and understand their needs." - Bill Gates
